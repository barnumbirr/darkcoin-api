darkcoin is an APACHE licensed library written in Python designed to provide a simple to use API for the Darkcoin cryptocurrency.

## More about Darkcoin:

Darkcoin was engineered to be a digital version of cash. Transactions are pooled together in the blockchain, making them anonymous from the wallet.

You can send Darkcoin to family or friends, or pay for goods or services, anywhere in the world. The network is decentralized and free from middlemen. It's an anonymous payment system in your control. Darkcoin is a decentralized currency, meaning there are no banks to take a cut of your money.

## Installation:

From source use

    $ python setup.py install

or install from PyPi

    $ pip install darkcoin
